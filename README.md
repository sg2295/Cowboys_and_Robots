# Cowboys and Robots
## About the problem 📜
Cowboys and Robots is a new spin on the classic river-crossing problem, "*Missionairies and Cannibals*". It was used as practice for representing problems in such a way that they could be solved by employing uninformed search algorithms. This particular problem was suggested as *advanced work* for a Univeristy module on Artificial Intelligence.

The problem is well-kown in AI literature, and was famously used by Saul Amarel (*On represntations of problems of reasoning about actions, Machine Intelligence*). The different name "Cowboys and Robots" was chosen in an attempt to move away from the problematic theme of the problem, which evokes images of colonialism.
### The rules 
Imagine three cowboys and three robots want to cross a river. With them, they have a boat that can hold one or two individuals at a time. We can never have a group of cowboys be outnumbered by the robots, in either side of the river. Find a way to get everyone to the other side of a river.

Original description:
> "Three missionaries and three cannibals are on one side of a river, along with a boat that can hold one or two people. Find a way to get everyone to the other side without ever leaving a group of missionaries in one place outnumbered by the cannibals in that place."



## Implementation 🔍
The project includes different uninformed searching algorithms capable of finding a solution to the problem. Currently supported algorithms include: Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, and Iterative-Deepening Search.
### Breadth-First Search
```g.breadth_first_search()```
### Depth-First Search
```g.depth_first_search()```
### Iterative-Deepening Search
```g.iterative_deepening_search()```
